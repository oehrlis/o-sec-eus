# Exercises

The exercises are grouped in individual directories and can generally be performed independently of each other. Each exercise contains at least a short description of the tasks (`1x??en-Exercise.md`) as well as a solution (`1x??en-Solution.md`). In addition, scripts, docker files, etc. are part of every exercise. For exercises where software (Oracle Binaries, Patch) or code from other Git repositories is required, we refer to it accordingly.
