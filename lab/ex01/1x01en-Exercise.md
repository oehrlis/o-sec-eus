## Exercise 1: Get known the Environment

### Exercise Goals

Simple exercise to get to know the environment.

- Everybody can access his/her compute instance.

### Tasks

- Login to your individual OCI compute instance via jump host `osec-jumpNN.trivadislabs.com`
- Login to the DB server `10.0.1.6` or `db.trivadislab.com` over jump host and/or `ssh` ProxyCommand.
- Login to the OUD server `10.0.1.5` or `oud.trivadislab.com` over jump host and/or `ssh` ProxyCommand.
- Setup ssh port forwarding for remote desktop (3389)
- Login to the AD server `10.0.1.4` or `ad.trivadislab.com` using MS remote desktop over port forwarding.
- Check environments on DB server and AD server. OUD is currently still rather empty.
